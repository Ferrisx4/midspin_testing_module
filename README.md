# Midspin Testing Module
This is a module that will used by Ferris to test various Drupal functionalities. It'll probably become bloated and silly over time but for now it's better than having a bunch of 2-bit repos clogging up teh githubs, eh?

Each "functionality" will have its own section in the `includes/` directory. They won't be broken down into individual modules like Tripal does for now (but they probably should be).
