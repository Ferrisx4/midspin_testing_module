# Midspin Testing Module
This is a module that will used by Ferris to test various Drupal functionalities. It'll probably become bloated and silly over time but for now it's better than having a bunch of 2-bit repos clogging up teh githubs, eh?

Each "functionality" has its own module in the `submodules/` directory, so at least there's that (to be selective about the bloat).
